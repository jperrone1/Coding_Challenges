Q: Explain how MVC works. Why is it beneficial? Diagrams, please. 

A: MVC stands for Model, View, Controller.  It is an approach to producing web applications. 

The Model represents the data model of the application. 

The View represents the way the information is presented to the user of the web app. 

The Controller contains the logic that processes the data and feeds the information to the view.
